#  pFedDef: Defending Grey-Box Attacks for Personalized Federated Learning

## Summary: 
With the exponential growth of data generated by modern computing devices, preserving user privacy while harnessing the potential of this data is crucial. Federated learning has emerged as a promising approach to address privacy concerns, enabling collaborative training of machine learning models without sharing individual data. However, this distributed nature introduces security challenges, particularly evasion attacks, in which malicious participants manipulate models during testing. Adversarial training has been widely adopted to defend against such attacks by incorporating adversarial examples during model training.This work explores the intersection of adversarial training and poisoning attacks in federated learning, introducing Adversarial Robustness Unhardening (ARU). ARU aims to weaken models' robustness by exploiting the decentralized training process, making them more vulnerable to evasion attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of ARU on existing defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, and propose novel defenses to enhance the security of federated learning models. Our research sheds light on the new threat posed by ARU and advances the understanding of securing federated learning systems against sophisticated adversarial attacks while preserving data privacy.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All experiments require NVIDIA GPU and CUDA library.
All experiments of this paper are run on the Amazon EC2 instance G4DN.XLARGE.

## Data Sets

The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets are readily available to set up with the existing infrastructure of FedEM. The CelebA data set can be found and downloaded at [LEAF](https://leaf.cmu.edu/), while the MovieLens data set is found at [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).


## Original Repository

The code from this repository has been heavily adapted from: [Federated Multi-Task Learning under a Mixture of Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10252). The code is found at https://github.com/omarfoq/FedEM.

The following components of their work has been used as a basis for our work.

- data folder with the data set downloading and data splitting
- learner folder with learner and learners_ensemble classes
- 'client.py', 'aggregator.py' classes 


## Training

The model weights can be trained given varying methods of adversarial training and aggregation method by running the .py files in the 'run_experiments_collection' folder. Move the .py file to the root directory and follow the instructions to run each experiment.

The scripts have been written in such a way that an individual script can be run for consecutive training of related neural networks. All experiments require NVIDIA GPU and CUDA library, and has been run on AWS EC2 g4dn.xlarge instance.

## Evaluation

The Notebooks folder provides jupyter notebook that could be used for evaluation.
